# Displacement-of-objects-in-an-image-using-YOLOv8

-> This object detection model was built using YOLOv8 which detects the object in an image and constructs the homogeneous transformation matrix which consists of the displacement and orientation information of the object between two images.
-> The output is a plot which constis of original axes, new axes and the orientation angle between them.
